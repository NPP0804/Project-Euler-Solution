# Solution of Problem 56 Project Euler
This is my solution of Problem 56 Project Euler.

## The Original Problem
A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?

## My Modified Problem
Find the maximum digital sum of a^b where a, b < N, where N is users input

## Installation
Make sure you have python installed on your computer. You can check it with this command on your terminal:
```
python --version
```
The command above should write the installed python version on your computer.

If you don't have python installed on your computer, you can download Python Installer for Windows [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the "Add to environment PATH" selection on installation.

For linux computer, you can install it by running this command:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

## Executing the Solution
The answer program can be run by this command:
```
python answer.py <Number>
```
Example
```
python answer.py 100
```

## Technology Used
